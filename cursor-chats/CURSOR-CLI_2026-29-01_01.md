<git_status>
This is the git status at the start of the conversation. Note that this status is a snapshot in time, and will not update during the conversation.

## main...origin/main

</git_status>

<rules>
The rules section has a number of possible rules/memories/context that you should consider. In each subsection, we provide instructions about what information the subsection contains and how you should consider/follow the contents of the subsection.


<always_applied_workspace_rules description="These are workspace-level rules that the agent must always follow.">
<always_applied_workspace_rule name="/Users/ankit/Playground/ai_agent/.cursorrules"># Cursor Rules

**This file:** Adding too much leads to rules being ignored. Only add when needed. Do not change `.cursorrules` without asking the user.

**Prefer local tools over sending data to servers.** When a task can be done locally (e.g. copy a file, search the codebase, transform text), use local execution (copy tool, read+write, grep) rather than sending content to an external service to do the same thing.

## 🔄 Session Continuity

**⚠️ ALWAYS run at conversation start (no exceptions):**
1. Run `git --no-pager log --stat -5`
2. Run `python cursor-scripts/cursor_usage.py reminder --once`
3. Run `python cursor-scripts/startup_cards.py` for daily digest + quiz
4. Summarize recent work

**Then:**
- User gave specific task → Do the task immediately after summary
- User says "resume", "continue" → Resume previous work
- Otherwise → Ask: "Resume from where we left off, or start something new?"

**No skipping:** These checks surface critical context (recent changes, learning reminders) that affects task execution.

---

### 🔄 New Chat

**Trigger:** User says "new chat", "start fresh", "clear chat", etc.

**Run:**
```bash
./cursor-scripts/cursor-new-chat.sh
```

This exports the current chat and clears history. User then restarts CLI agent.

---

### 📝 Conversation Export

**Trigger (immediate, no confirmation):**
- `/e` - Export conversation

**Run:**
```bash
./cursor-scripts/export-chat.sh
```

**Confirm:** "Exported to `cursor-chats/CURSOR-CLI_YYYY-MM-DD.md`"

---

### 🚫 Workspace Boundaries

**DO NOT access files outside workspace without explicit permission.**

Includes: `~/.zshrc`, `~/.config/*`, `~/.ssh/*`, any external path

**Workflow for external files:**
1. Ask: "I need to edit `~/.zshrc`. Can you copy it to `./temp/`?"
2. User copies to `./temp/`
3. AI edits `./temp/<filename>`
4. User copies back, confirms "done"
5. AI cleans up: `rm -rf ./temp/* ./temp/.* 2>/dev/null; true`

**Exception:** Only if user explicitly instructs (e.g., "read my ~/.zshrc")

---

### 🔬 Research Protocol (Multi-Source Grounding)

**Goal:** Ground answers in verifiable sources (codebase, docs, web) rather than relying on training data alone.

**When to trigger:** Any question requiring factual accuracy, technical details, best practices, or current information.

**Mandatory source order:**

| Step | Source | Method | When to Use |
|------|--------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | **Codebase** | Grep/Glob/Read | Always first - check existing code/patterns |
| 2 | **Local Docs** | Read `.md` files | Project-specific guides, READMEs |
| 3 | **Web Search** | `web_search.py` | Queries, discovery, external info |
| 4 | **WebFetch** | `WebFetch` tool | Known URLs, specific doc pages |
| 5 | **Browser** | Browser MCP tools | JS-rendered pages (IDE only) |

**Web tool hierarchy:**
| Tool | Best For | Speed | When to Use |
|------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `web_search.py` | Queries, discovery | Fast | Primary - Gemini + Google grounding |
| `WebFetch` | Specific URLs | Medium | Secondary - direct fetch of known pages |
| Browser MCP | JS pages, interaction | Slow | Fallback (IDE only — not available in Cursor CLI) |

**Browser MCP:** Available in **IDE only**. Not available in Cursor CLI — use `web_search.py` or WebFetch instead.

**Use Browser MCP when (IDE only):**
- Page requires JavaScript rendering (WebFetch returns incomplete/empty)
- Need to navigate or interact with the page
- Visual verification needed
- Other methods fail or return partial data

**Execution rules:**
- **Run sources in parallel** when independent (e.g., grep codebase + read docs simultaneously)
- **Cite sources** in response (file paths, URLs from web search)
- **Skip steps** only if clearly irrelevant (e.g., skip codebase for "what's the weather")
- **Escalate to browser** only when faster methods fail (IDE; in CLI use WebFetch or web search)

**Example triggers:**
- "How do I use X?" → Codebase (existing examples) → Docs → Web (official docs)
- "What's the best way to Y?" → Codebase (current approach) → Web (best practices)
- "Is Z still supported?" → Web (latest info) → Docs (local notes)

**CLI execution:**
```bash
# Codebase search
rg "pattern" --type py

# Web search (grounded)
python cursor-scripts/web_search.py "query"
```

```

**Data storage:** `cursor-data/flashcards.json`

### Model Selection

**⚠️ BEFORE recommending ANY model:**
1. **Fetch latest benchmarks** — don't rely on outdated knowledge
2. **Infer task type** from user's question
3. **Follow the workflow below**

**Workflow:**

1. **Automatically fetch latest benchmarks:**
 ```bash
 python cursor-scripts/get_model_benchmarks.py [task_type]
 ```
 - `task_type`: `coding`, `reasoning`, `writing`, `fast`, or `general`
 - Infer from user's question if not specified

2. **Make recommendation based on:**
 - Latest third-party benchmarks (LMSYS Arena, SWE-bench, HumanEval, etc.)
 - Task requirements (coding, reasoning, speed, cost)
 - Cost considerations (from latest pricing data)
 - User's specific needs

### Git Commits

**⚠️ BEFORE committing, follow `COMMIT-CONVENTIONS.md`:**
- Use tags: `add:`, `update:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `style:`, `revert:`
- Format: `<tag>: <description>`
- Date format in filenames: `YYYY-DD-MM`

### Documentation Files

- `COMMIT-CONVENTIONS.md` - Git commit message format
- `cursor-scripts/` - CLI tools and utilities
- `cursor-chats/` - Conversation logs
- `cursor-web-search/` - Web search logs
- `cursor-data/` - Flashcard and learning data

### Adding Project-Specific Rules

To customize for your project, add sections below this line:
- Domain-specific protocols (e.g., API wrappers, testing workflows)
- Project-specific tool paths
- Custom environment detection (if needed)

---

## 🔧 Project-Specific Rules

<!-- Add your project-specific rules below --></always_applied_workspace_rule>
</always_applied_workspace_rules>
</rules>

<mcp_instructions description="Instructions provided by MCP servers to help use them properly">
Server: _QuantConnect_DISABLED
For Python projects, write code in PEP8 style (snake_case) or convert the code using the PEP8 Converter Tool (`update_code_to_pep8`).

Before running backtests, run the compile tool (`create_compile` and `read_compile`) to get the syntax errors and then fix them.

Where more efficient, use the `patch_file` tool to only update the lines of code with errors instead of using the `update_file_contents` tool.

You are an expert quant that assists QuantConnect members with designing, coding, and testing algorithms. Take the initiative as often as possible.

The project Id is in the config file, under `cloud-id`.

**User**

<user_query>
sync with the template
</user_query>

---

**Assistant**

<think>
The user wants to sync with "the template". I need to understand what template they're referring to. Looking at the project layout, I see:
- TEMPLATE-MAINTENANCE.md
- TEMPLATE-SETUP.md
- create-repo-with-kit.sh

So this project appears to have template-related documentation. Let me run the session continuity steps first as per .cursorrules, then look at the template docs to understand how to "sync with the template".

I'll:
1. Run git log
2. Run cursor_usage.py reminder
3. Run startup_cards.py
4. Read TEMPLATE-MAINTENANCE.md and TEMPLATE-SETUP.md to understand sync process
</think>
Running session continuity checks and checking template docs to determine how we sync with the template.

<tool_call: Read (id: tool_3c6)>

---

**Assistant**

<think>
The TEMPLATE-MAINTENANCE.md describes syncing **from** the source of truth (quant/cursor-starter-kit) **to** the template repo. But the user said "sync with the template" - which could mean:

1. **Pull from template** into this repo (ai_agent) - i.e. this repo was created from the template and they want to get latest template changes
2. **Push to template** - but that's done from quant/cursor-starter-kit

Looking at the git log, I see:
- "sync: Merge template/main (cursor-starter-kit-template)" 
- "sync: Update from source of truth"

So this repo (ai_agent) has been merging from the template before. So "sync with the template" in this context likely means: **pull/merge the latest changes from the template repository (cursor-starter-kit-template) into this repo**.

Let me check if there's a remote for the template and how they've been doing the merge.
</think>
Checking how this repo is set up relative to the template and how previous syncs were done:

<tool_call: Shell (id: tool_228)>
<tool_call: Grep (id: tool_517)>

---

**Assistant**

<think>
README.md says:
```
To update from the template:
git fetch template
git merge template/master --allow-unrelated-histories
```

But the previous merges in git log used `template/main`:
- "sync: Merge template/main (cursor-starter-kit-template)"

The remote has both `template/main` and `template/master`. I'll fetch and then merge. I'll use template/main since that's what was used in the last sync. Let me check - the last merge was "Merge template/main" so they're using main. I'll fetch and merge template/main.
</think>
Fetching the template and merging `template/main` (matching previous syncs).

<tool_call: Shell (id: tool_1fa)>

---

**Assistant**

<think>
There are new commits on template/main (d3797b0..55dbb3c). Let me merge them.
</think>
Merging template/main into main.

<tool_call: Shell (id: tool_52d)>

---

**Assistant**

<think>
Merge completed. The template had removed search_script and its test, and made some README/CURSOR-TOOLS changes. I'll summarize for the user.
</think>
Summary of the sync:

**Fetched** from `template` and **merged** `template/main` into `main`.

**Changes brought in from the template:**
- **Removed:** `cursor-scripts/search_script.py`
- **Removed:** `tests/test_search_script.py`
- **Updated:** `README.md` (4 lines)
- **Updated:** `CURSOR-TOOLS.md` (7 lines removed)
- **Updated:** `tests/README.md` (2 lines removed)
- **Updated:** `tests/run_all.py` (1 line, likely dropping the search_script test)

Merge commit: `sync: Merge template/main (cursor-starter-kit-template)`.

You still have uncommitted changes in `cursor-chats/CURSOR-CLI_2026-29-01_01.md`. Push when ready with:

```bash
git push origin main
```

---

**User**

<user_query>
stage commit push
</user_query>

---

**Assistant**

<think>
The user wants me to stage, commit, and push. Let me check the current git status first to see what needs to be staged - they mentioned cursor-chats had changes. I'll stage all changes, commit with an appropriate message per COMMIT-CONVENTIONS.md, and push.
</think>


<tool_call: Shell (id: tool_06b)>

---

**Assistant**

<think>
There's one modified file: cursor-chats/CURSOR-CLI_2026-29-01_01.md. Per COMMIT-CONVENTIONS.md I should use tags like update:, add:, fix:, etc. This is updating a chat export file, so "update: chat export for 2026-29-01" would be appropriate (matching the pattern from the git log I saw earlier).
</think>


<tool_call: Shell (id: tool_579)>

---

**Assistant**

<think>
Done. Staged the chat export file, committed with the conventional message, and pushed to origin/main.
</think>
Completed:

- **Staged:** `cursor-chats/CURSOR-CLI_2026-29-01_01.md`
- **Committed:** `update: chat export for 2026-29-01` (494 insertions)
- **Pushed:** `main` → `origin/main`

<rules>
The rules section has a number of possible rules/memories/context that you should consider. In each subsection, we provide instructions about what information the subsection contains and how you should consider/follow the contents of the subsection.


<always_applied_workspace_rules description="These are workspace-level rules that the agent must always follow.">
<always_applied_workspace_rule name="/Users/ankit/Playground/ai_agent/.cursorrules"># Cursor Rules

**This file:** Adding too much leads to rules being ignored. Only add when needed. Do not change `.cursorrules` without asking the user.

**Prefer local tools over sending data to servers.** When a task can be done locally (e.g. copy a file, search the codebase, transform text), use local execution (copy tool, read+write, grep) rather than sending content to an external service to do the same thing.

## 🔄 Session Continuity

2. Run `python cursor-scripts/cursor_usage.py reminder --once`
3. Run `python cursor-scripts/startup_cards.py` for daily digest + quiz
4. Summarize recent work

**Then:**
- User gave specific task → Do the task immediately after summary
- User says "resume", "continue" → Resume previous work
- Otherwise → Ask: "Resume from where we left off, or start something new?"

**No skipping:** These checks surface critical context (recent changes, learning reminders) that affects task execution.

**Self-check:** Run startup checks at conversation start (git log, cursor_usage reminder, startup_cards, summarize).

<mcp_instructions description="Instructions provided by MCP servers to help use them properly">
Server: _QuantConnect_DISABLED
For Python projects, write code in PEP8 style (snake_case) or convert the code using the PEP8 Converter Tool (`update_code_to_pep8`).

Before running backtests, run the compile tool (`create_compile` and `read_compile`) to get the syntax errors and then fix them.

Where more efficient, use the `patch_file` tool to only update the lines of code with errors instead of using the `update_file_contents` tool.

You are an expert quant that assists QuantConnect members with designing, coding, and testing algorithms. Take the initiative as often as possible.

## Evaluation: cursor-starter-kit-template

This is a **GitHub template repository** for setting up Cursor CLI workflows. Here's my assessment:

### Overview
A well-organized template that provides AI-assisted development workflows with focus on **verifiability** (don't just trust model training data — ground answers in sources).

### Strengths

| Area | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Documentation** | Excellent README, setup guides, and inline docstrings |
| **Tool Coverage** | Usage tracking, chat export, web search, flashcards, model benchmarks |
| **Code Quality** | Clean Python, proper error handling, sensible defaults |
| **Testing** | Test suite with `--skip-api` option for CI without credentials |
| **Extensibility** | Clear "Project-Specific Rules" section in `.cursorrules` |
| **Session Continuity** | Mandates startup checks (git log, reminders, quiz) to ground AI context |

### Key Tools

1. **`cursor_usage.py`** - Comprehensive usage tracking with quota/budget/alerts (On-Demand vs Included billing)
2. **`web_search.py`** - Gemini-powered search with auto-logging (solves training data staleness)
3. **`review.py` + `startup_cards.py`** - SM-2 spaced repetition flashcard system
4. **`export-chat.sh`** - Chat export to markdown for reference

### Architecture Decisions

- **SQLite** for usage data (portable, no external deps)
- **Minimal deps** - only `google-genai` and `python-dotenv`
- **Local-first** - prefers local tools over sending data to servers
- **Multi-source grounding protocol** in `.cursorrules` (codebase → docs → web → browser)

### Observations

1. This is the **source template** for your current workspace (`ai_agent`)
2. Uses `YYYY-DD-MM` date format (European-style, defined in `COMMIT-CONVENTIONS.md`)
3. The MCP bypass skeleton provides a workaround for Cursor's MCP serialization issues
4. Pro+ plan assumptions baked in ($70 base + $100 on-demand)

### Minor Issues

- Hardcoded Pro+ pricing could be config-driven
- Some test files exist but are minimal (e.g., `test_fresh_agent.py` was recently trimmed)

### Verdict

**Well-designed, production-ready template** for Cursor CLI power users. The emphasis on research protocol and source verification is particularly valuable for reducing AI hallucinations.

What about the new chat feature to manage context exhaustion? Not worth mentioning?
</user_query>

---

**Assistant**

You're right, that's a notable feature. Let me check it.
<tool_call: Read (id: toolu_01)>

---

**Assistant**

Good call. The **new chat feature** (`cursor-new-chat.sh`) addresses a real pain point:

### Context Window Management

**Problem:** As Cursor's context window fills (shown in footer %), model responsiveness degrades.

**Solution:** Export + clear in one step:
```bash
./cursor-scripts/cursor-new-chat.sh
```

**What it does:**
1. Exports current chat to `cursor-chats/` (preserving history for reference)
2. Clears `~/.cursor/chats/<workspace>/` 
3. Prompts user to restart CLI agent

**Options:**
- `--no-export` - Skip export, just clear (if chat is already saved)

**Why it matters:**
- Prevents "model getting dumber" as context fills
- Chats aren't lost — they're exported to markdown first
- Quick trigger: just say "new chat" (per `.cursorrules`)

This is a practical workflow solution that other Cursor setups don't typically address. Worth highlighting in any evaluation.

**User**

<user_query>
What would make managing context exhastion worthin mentioning in the first pass? I want to make sure if people use an ai tool to evaluate the repo, it is mentioned.
</user_query>

---

**Assistant**

The issue is **visibility in the README**. When I scanned it, context exhaustion is mentioned but buried:

1. **In the tools table** — one row among many
2. **In a bullet point** — "New chat... Also helps manage Cursor's context-window usage"
3. **No dedicated section** — it's treated as a minor feature

### Recommendations to Surface It

**Option 1: Add to opening philosophy**

```markdown
**Philosophy:** AI answers should be verified... This template also addresses 
**context window exhaustion** — when Cursor's context fills up, responses degrade. 
The new-chat workflow exports and clears history to keep the model responsive.
```

**Option 2: Promote to "Key Features" with problem framing**

```markdown
### Key Features

- **Context exhaustion management**: When Cursor's context window fills (footer %), 
  the model slows down. `cursor-new-chat.sh` exports your chat and clears history 
  for a fresh start — no lost conversations.
```

**Option 3: Add a dedicated section**

```markdown
## Context Window Management

Cursor's context window has limits. As it fills (watch the % in the footer), 
responses get slower and less accurate. 

**Solution:** Run `./cursor-scripts/cursor-new-chat.sh` to:
1. Export current chat to `cursor-chats/` (nothing lost)
2. Clear history
3. Restart fresh

Trigger: Just say "new chat" in conversation.
```

**Why I missed it:** AI evaluators scan for section headers, opening paragraphs, and feature lists. Buried bullet points get deprioritized. Problem-solution framing in a visible location would fix this.

Want me to update the template's README with one of these approaches?
